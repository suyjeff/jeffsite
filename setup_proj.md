Use this guide to setup the entire project.

It's intended to be a simple portfolio website that is mostly text and will link to several case studies. I'd like these case study pages to be created from markdown files that I write. I'm not sure which frameworks to use to accomplish this, so feel free to use your best judgement.

Other than that, I'd like to use React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS, amongst whatever other libraries you think are necessary. I plan on deploying this website through GitHub pages.

The website should be fast and efficient, and allow me to update the design and content relatively easily.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy. Write everything that is needed.

Your goal is to competely finish the website.

Look to a site like this one: https://benji.org/ for inspiration.
