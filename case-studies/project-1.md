# Project 1: Web Application

This is a case study for Project 1, a web application I developed using React and Node.js.

## Challenge

The main challenge was to create a scalable and efficient web application that could handle a large number of concurrent users.

## Solution

I implemented a microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Results

The application successfully launched and now serves over 10,000 daily active users.
